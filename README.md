### DynamicEstimationDTSD

Simulation and real dataset codes for the paper "Dynamic estimation with random forests for discrete-time survival data"

Simulation:
- To obtain the accuracy values for each evaluation measurement, use predfunc.R
- To produce the boxplot for each model setup, use boxplotfunc.R
- To produce the main effects plots across all factors, use maineffectsfunc.R
- The example codes are given in run.R for reproducing the boxplots and main effects plots.

Real dataset:
- Dataset description (The real dataset is not open to public and cannot be shared).
- Codes to compute the AUC and ROC, as well as the Brier scores.
